                <p class="insideCurrentText">I am currently a department manager at Macy's in Downtown Seattle under
                    the Executive Development Program. My job compromises of overseeing associates and ensuring that
                    the day-to-day operations of millions of dollars in merchandise goes smoothly. A big part of the
                    job requires that I create a fine-balance between managing the department as well as serving
                    customers and their needs first-hand. <br><br>

                    One aspect of my job is the responsibility to analyze business trends and work with the district
                    teams to ensure that the merchandise selections are
                    fit for the store. I have experience with coaching over 20 associates in the department and
                    ensuring that they have a customer-focused environment in which the needs of the customer are
                    precedent. <br><br>

                    Another responsibility I hold is helping assist with the hiring decisions within the
                    building as well as conducting interviews. These tasks require both sound judgment in candidates
                    as well as the requirement to create friendly and conducive environments.
